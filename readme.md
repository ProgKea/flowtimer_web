# Flowtimer web

A simple web port of a [script](https://github.com/ProgKea/.ansible_dotfiles_installer/blob/master/programs/scripts/flowtimer) i use to calculate a optimal break length.

I ported it to web so I am able to use this on machines that don't have bash.

The site is hosted here: https://progkea.github.io/flowtimer_web/
